**Spring Boot Project:** Money Transfer Between Accounts

****Project Structure:****

**Controller Layer:**

	AccountsController: Manages account creation and retrieves account information.
	TransferController: Handles transfers between accounts.
 
**Service Layer:**

	AccountService: Provides methods to perform account-related operations.
	TransferService: Manages money transfer between accounts, ensuring thread safety and no negative balances.
	Data Layer:
	
	In-memory database using  to store accounts.

**Notification Layer:**

	NotificationService: Interface for sending notifications after transfers. Implementation is assumed to be done by another developer.
	Thread Safety:
	
	The TransferService ensures thread-safe operations using ReentrantLock for fine-grained locking at the account level.

****Pre-production Considerations:****

**Persistent Storage:**
	
		Replace the in-memory ConcurrentHashMap with a persistent database such as PostgreSQL.
 
**Concurrency Testing:**
	
		Conduct load testing with multiple concurrent transfers to verify thread safety.
 
**Error Handling:**
	
		Improve error handling and return meaningful HTTP responses for failed transfers.
 
**Transaction Management:**
	
		Use distributed transaction management (e.g., Spring's transaction management) if using a persistent DB.
 
**Security:**
	
		Implement authentication and authorization for account access and transfers (e.g., Spring Security).
 
**Logging and Monitoring:**
	
		Add logging, monitoring, and alerting for key operations, especially transfers.
 
**Scalability:**
	
		Ensure the system can scale horizontally with increased load.
 
**Validation:**
	
		Validate inputs more thoroughly (e.g., amount should be positive, account IDs should exist).
